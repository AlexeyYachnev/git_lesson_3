# **Work with Git**

## What is the Git?

* Keeps and uses information
* Helps to control information
* Stores multiple versions of the same file
* Helps to avoid confusion about file versions when editing multiple times
* ~~Buy It!~~ FREE for all

## Let's try to use It possible

When using program Git, you will need to learn a few command codes
* ***git init*** - initializing the local repository
* ***git status*** - report status, soldier!
* ***git add*** - add file or files to next commit
* ***git commit -m "message"*** - create commit
* ***git log*** - history of your work
* ***git checkout*** - transmit to another commit
* ***git checkout master*** - back to main branch
* ***git diff*** - see all yours mistakes
* ***branch*** - will see branches
* ***branch branch name*** - create and name branch 
* ***git checkout*** - jumping like squirrel from branch to branch
* ***git branch -d branch name*** delete branch 

## If you suddenly use Markdown

Learn the syntax, bro!

* (#) or (=)  - # First level header
* (##) or (-) - ## Point ahead
* (**) or (__) - __BOLD__
* (*) or (_) - *Italics*
* (~~) - ~~Cross out~~
* (***) - ***BOLD Italics***

## Work with remote repositories

***Work remotely, work from home!***

To get started, you will need to register on the GitHub platform
- Why is this necessary?
- GitHub is a cloud storage of data, files and various code. If you have access to the files, then you can download and edit them, and then upload your own version so that other users who will have access can also download your version and edit it.
- And everything will be fine, this is Lyuba saying

Let's do it step by step

1. We pass a simple registration

2. Но никак не получается пушить в GitHub
